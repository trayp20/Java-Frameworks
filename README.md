# Java-Frameworks
This project customizes a Spring Framework inventory management application with a user-friendly HTML front-end for a fictional store. Key enhancements include a tailored interface displaying product and part names, an About page, and a "Buy Now" button for easy purchasing. The application enforces inventory limits with maximum and minimum values and provides validation for inventory management. Additional unit tests ensure robust functionality. Built with object-oriented programming principles, the project is an example of interface design, framework use, and back-end integration, making it portfolio-ready for technical interviews and professional use.
